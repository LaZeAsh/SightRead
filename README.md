# Braille-Interpreter

An app to educate the world about braille and change the way the world interacts with the visually impaired.

##  💡 Inspiration 💡

In many countries around the world, braille is the preferred method of delivering information for people who are blind or partially sighted. Hence, those who aren't fluent in braille are missing out on the important dialogues and experiences from such groups who communicate in braille. This app aims to bridge that gap and increase global fluency in braille, leading to more accessible tools and resources being developed for the blind community.


## ⚙️ What it does ⚙️

Users can translate text into braille to communicate with the blind and partially sighted. Users can also take photos of braille and translate it into text. Lastly, users can take photos of braille and translate that into spoken English text (i.e. braille-to-speech). All of these features allow users to learn and practice braille, improving their braille literacy and thus strengthening their connectedness with the blind and partially sighted. 

## 🏗️ How we built it 🏗️

We used Swift and SwiftUI to build a user-friendly frontend experience--i.e. a clean, minimal layout with high-contrasting colours so the partially sighted can navigate the app with ease. 

The back end is built using Python and uses OpenCV to identify the text and braille within images.
